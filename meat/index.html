      ow much meat is too much meat?
      Some may say there is no such
      thing while others say
      that any consumption of meat is
      too much.
      While many may debate these opinions,
      it is important to see the effect that the mass production of meat is
      having on the environment and our health.
      Meat is a great source of protein,
      B12, and Iron [1],
      however; in excess it can have detrimental effects on our society.
      High cholesterol [2],
      antibiotic resistance [4],
      and greenhouse gases [5]
      are just a few of the consequences
      the livestock industry is having in
      our planet.
      If we don’t act now the
      effects of it may be irreversible. [5]

    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">
        In this analysis,
        we will explore the environmental
        consequences of the mass production
        of animal farming and what we can
        to create a more sustainable ecosystem.
        By diving this analysis
        into three parts: production,
        consumption, and effects.

      nimal farming has been around since the
      "Neolithic Revolution" around 10,000 years ago,
      but may have begun much earlier [3].
      Most of these farmers had a handful
      of domesticated animals that they would
      trade for goods or use for consumption.
      The Industrial Revolution in the late
      19th century introduced the concept
      of factory farming forever changing
      the way we eat [3].

<h1> World Meat Production </h1>
  <img src = ../images/meatP.gif class="center"> </img>
    <p class="margin-top-10">
      Starting in the 1960’s we
      see a spike in meat
      production which is then followed by an
      exorbitant growth in the 90's. [6]
      If we look at the late 2000’s
      we see that we globally we produce about
      342 <bold> Million Tons </bold> of meat that is
      754 <bold> billion lbs. </bold>
      We see a 380% growth in production since 1963.[6]
      The National Center for Biotechnology
      Information expects the number
      of farm animals produced each year
      is estimated to double in 30 years [7].
      (684 million tons / 1508 billion lbs.)
      But where is this spike in production coming from?
   </p>
   <!-- Continent chart world -->
   <h1> Continent Meat Production </h1>
    <img src = ../images/world.gif class="center"> </img>
    <p class="margin-top-10">
      When we divide the data by continent [6],
      we see that the biggest consumer
      of meat today is Asia,
      they overtake the rest of the world by
      almost 2X as much production.
      The underlying factor is East Asia.
      Surprisingly,
      on the other hand, the smallest consumer
      of meat is Australia and Africa,
      their production of meat has remained
      steady since the 60's. In Europe we see a spike in meat
      production followed by a dip in 1995
      which remains steady to 2020.
      There has been research done which concluded that
      meat production rises as a country gets
      richer [8].
      This theory proves to be correct when we compare the GDP
      of East Asia and their meat production,
      we 1995 was the turn point for both of these variables.[9]

<section>
<div class="parallax-two">
<h2>Consumption </h2>
</div>

<section>
<div class="block">
<p><span class="first-character ny">H</span>
  ow much meat per capita does the we consume in a year?
  When we look at the amount of meat
  (red and poultry) consumed in the United states
  from 1960 to 2020.[10]
  On average the per capita amount is 201 lbs. per person in a year
  with a standard deviation of 12 lbs.
  When we draw various samples of the data [10],
  we obtain different results and our results are
  not accurate.
  For example, when we draw 3 simple random samples, we see that the data seems to be going up, however;
  when we draw 50 + samples using simple random selection without replacement we see that the chart is not constant.
  This is due to the fact that meat consumption
  is not a constant spike and extracting samples from different
  years skews the data and provides an erroneous
  conclusion. From my observations some journals will extract
  data from various sets and provide only a small set of information
  ;they then declare them as facts [11].
  Therefore, it is always important to
  look at the growing trends holistically
  rather than in a micro scale.
</p>
<h1> Sample Data Extraction </h1>

<!-- Per capita chart world -->
<h1> Per Capita Consumption in the USA in a year </h1>
<img src = ../images/meatUSA.gif class="center"> </img>
<p class="margin-top-10">
Consumption in the USA has its ups and downs, the slope is not constant, but on average Americans consume 200lbs of meat every year. That is 16 lbs. per month or half a pound a day. To have more context one burger is around .25 lbs., this means that the average American is consuming two quarter lbs. burgers per day every single day. But does this apply to all those who live in the US?
</p>

<!-- Standard deviation chart world -->
<h1> Standard deviation chart world </h1>
<img src = ../images/usa.png class="center"> </img>
<p>
The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ(MU) and standard deviation σ (sigma)  and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement,
 then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.
 In this case we see that CLT applies to the charts since the more samples we extract the more uniform the sampling distribution for per capita meat consumption becomes.
 In this chart we start to see a normal distribution for the average American consuming around 200 lbs. per meat each year. Meaning yes, most Americans are in fact coursing around two burgers per day every day.

      very action as a group we take has a considerable
      result in our environment.
      In the previous section we observed the insatiable
      desire for meat the world is craving,
      now we will analyze two environmental livestock byproducts.
</p>
  <h1> Antibiotic Use in Cattle </h1>
    <p class="margin-top-10">
According to the CDC “Antibiotic resistance
is one of the greatest public health challenges
of our time—few treatment options exist for
people infected with antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.” [12]
Antibiotics given to livestock
today surpasses 20 million pounds in the US alone, [13]
this is 80% of all antibiotics sold in the US [14].
this means that those who consume these animals are also
consuming a dose of those antibiotics.
This has become such a concern that the
FDA Announced an
Implementation of GFI /
Continuing Efforts to Address Antimicrobial
Resistance. [15]
However, there have been bills
introduced since 1999 attempting
to phase out the non-therapeutic use of
eight classes of medically important
antibiotics and restrict the use of many
other antibiotics in animal feed. [15]
That was more than 21 years ago and the
bills have never made it out of committee.
The National Center for Biotechnology Information
predicts that this number
will rise by 67% by 2030.
"This rise is likely to be driven
by the growth in consumer demand
for livestock products in middle-income
countries and a shift to large-scale
farms where antimicrobials are used routinely." NCBI [16]
So which countries will consume the most?
</p>
<img src = ../images/Anti1.png class="center"> </img>
<img src = ../images/Anti2.png class="center"> </img>

<!-- Antibiotic usage per country and double data-->
    <p>
      The top 5 countries that use the most antibiotics
      are China, USA, Brazil, Germany, and India. with a
      mean of 10.2%,
      with a standard deviation of 8.
      China surpasses the United States by almost
      twice as much (23% China v 13% USA)
      and both of them surpass Germany (3%)
      and India (3%) by more than 4 times.
      This means that five countries in the world
      account for more than 50% each year.
      Quantile Analysis:
       Min - 3,
       1st Q - 3,
        Median - 9,
        Mean - 10.2,
        3rd Q - 13,
        Max 23
    </p>

    <h1> Greenhouse Gasses </h1>
      <p class="margin-top-10">
As the population of the world
rises so does out carbon footprint
increases and greenhouse gases skyrocket.
Worldwide, livestock accounts for between
14.5 percent and 18 percent of
human-induced greenhouse gas emissions [17].
The most important greenhouse gases
from animal agriculture are methane
and nitrous oxide. [18]
Methane,
mainly produced by enteric fermentation
and manure storage,
is a gas which has an effect on global warming 28 times higher than carbon dioxide.[18]
  </p>
  <h1> Greenhouse effects by product </h1>
  <img src = ../images/gas.png class="center"> </img>
<p>
  When we look at the greenhouse gases by products, we see that beef
    is the leading product.
    The mean is 13.16 kg, with a SD of 10.19.
    When we divide the data, we see the following results of where the data is broken
    down:
  <br>
    Summary:
  <br>
       Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  <br>
    5.250   6.532  10.012  13.165  12.447  36.440
  <br>
    Quantiles:
  <br>
           0%       25%       50%       75%      100%
  <br>
   5.250000  6.531538 10.011605 12.446927 .
  <br>
   This is of great importance when you take into account
   the kinds of gases that are being released and the tremendous amount each of them hold.
   In 30 years, we see that the data will grow by more than double and this presents a massive challenge for our planet.

        hoices decide what future we will have and those choices come from how well informed we are. If we continue to consume meat at the scale, we have our world will no longer be able to sustain itself. Not only are we hosting 7.6 billion humans in the planet but also around 9 billion animals for livestock. How can we contribute to do so in 30-50 years if the growth for both of these variables has been massive?
        The harmonious balance between species has been decreasing while the farming of animals has increased. Antibiotic use has been on the rise and it is out of control and the greenhouse emissions caused by livestock alone are creating irreversible consequences for our planet.
        We need to reduce and restrict the amount of meat produced each year this will slow down the environmental impacts of livestock in our lives.

      <p class="margin-top-10">
        All the data sets with the exception of Antibiotic Use in the World and Meat Consumption in the USA were downloaded from their corresponding websites. Then exported as CSV’s and imported into R using the Read CSV command which the creates a data frame and the data can be extracted as desired.  The other two files (Antibiotic Use in the World and Meat Consumption in the USA) had to be extracted from their websites by hand due to the lack of a csv download option. For Antibiotic use the article and summary was read and the numbers they provided were placed into a data frame directly onto R. On the other hand, Meat Consumption in the USA, had to be copy pasted into an excel file since the data given was a table in html, the file was then converted into a csv and imported into R. The chart for GDP per capita was found from Google Scholar open source and was embedded as an HTML.
        All the data sets have been placed into a folder that can be downloaded below.
