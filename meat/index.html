      ow much meat is too much meat? Some may say there is no such thing while others may debate that any consumption of meat is too much meat. While both of these options can be debated there is one fact that cannot – The mass production of meat is having a massive effect on the environment and our health. Meat is a great source of protein, B12, and Iron, however; in excess it can have detrimental effects on our society. High cholesterol, antibiotic resistance, and greenhouse gases are just a few of the consequences the livestock industry is having in our planet. If we don’t act now the effects of it may be irreversible.

      Animal farming has been around since the "Neolithic Revolution" around 10,000 years ago but may have begun much earlier. Most of these farmers had a handful of domesticated animals that they would trade for goods or use for consumption. The concept of factory farming was not introduced until the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th century.
      Starting in the 1960’s we see a constant spike in animal factories is then followed by an exorbitant growth in the 80's. If we look at the late 2000’s we see that we globally we produce about
      342,422,466 million tons of meat that is 754,912,375,775 billion lbs. That is a 380% growth since 1963. The National Center for Biotechnology Information expects the number of farm animals produced each year is estimated to double in 30 years. But who is responsible for this massive spike?

      When we divide the data by continent, we see that the biggest consumer of meat today is Asia, they overtake the rest of the world by almost twice as much consumption. The underlying factor for this massive spike is East Asia.
      Meat consumption rises as a country gets richer, when we compare the GDP increase of East Asia, we see that the amount of meat they are consuming increased in 1995 along with their GDP.
