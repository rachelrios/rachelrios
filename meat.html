					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p> Animal farming has been around since the "Neolithic Revolution" around 10,000 years ago but may have begun much earlier.  Most of these farmers had a handful of domesticated animals that they would trade for goods or use for consumption. The concept of factory farming was not introduced until the Industrial Revolution in the late 19th  century. In the 1900â€™s we see a spike in animal factories that was then followed by an exorbitant growth in the 60's. Today we raise about 70 billion animals for food worldwide compared to 980 million in 1950. That is a 7142% growth in 70 years. The number of farm animals produced each year is estimated to double in 30 years but will out planet be able to sustain that many farm animals?
						In this analysis we will explore the environmental and health consequences of the mass production of animal farming, how the planet currently sustains 7.7 billion and 70 billion animals, and what we can to create a more sustainable ecosystem in the future.
